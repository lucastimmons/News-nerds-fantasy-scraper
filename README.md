News-nerds-fantasy-scraper
================

Simple web scraper to get the teams, the points and players from each member of the SELECT  FROM news_nerds; BPL fantasy football league. You can visualize the scores or something, I don't know. Done in node because javascript > all others.

* Make sure you have node set up first. That is important. 

* Put these files into a directory. Open your terminal window to that directory. 

* Install your dependencies by running (in your terminal): `npm install`

* Open `server.js` and change currentWeek on line 13 to whichever week's data you want to download. Save the file

* In your terminal run: node `server.js`

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081/scrape`

* Go back to your console and give it a minute. If all went well you will now have a console full of jsony goodness. 

* Copy the data and have fun. Up the Gunners and FOYS.
